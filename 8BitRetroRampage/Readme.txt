Thankyou very much for purchasing "8 Bit Retro Rampage: 1000 Sounds Inspired by Videogame History".

Within this pack, you will find over 1000 carefully-edited, ready-to-use wav files that span many game genres.

I hope the filenames are fairly self-explanatory - if the sound is intended to be used as a loop, then the filename will include "lp". If it is intended to be used as a randomly-selected sound within a given group, then it will be named the same as the other sounds within that group, numbered incrementally, and contain "rnd". When dealing with sound effects that are likely to be used a lot (e.g. weapons and explosions in a shooter-style game), then having slight variation within a particular sound group can be very useful.

The sounds themselves are very small in filesize, so should be usable in their original, uncompressed form. Please be aware that some of the sounds have very small looping sections which may not respond well to lossy audio codecs. For these sounds, I suggest leaving the format as original uncompressed PCM. The file sizes should still remain small, given the precision of the editing.


Thanks once again
